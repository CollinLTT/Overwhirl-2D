# Overwhirl-2D
A project made for the class CS-583 at San Diego State University in the Fall of 2021.

Overwhirl is a 2D obstacle platformer game based on the game Geometry Dash. It features fully custom sounds, music, and graphics all made by myself.

## How to Play:

- The game functions similarly to Geometry Dash where the only action to take in the game is to jump to avoid obstacles.
- To jump press the spacebar.


## Features:

- The game features fully custom sounds, music, graphics, and animations made by myself.
- Has the option to switch between three different wheel designs.
- Also has the option to switch between three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Overwhirl.


## Video Demo:

A video of the game in action can be seen here: [iOS App Demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/165S-_A97tA?feature=share). It first shows the live stream by clicking the play button on the home screen, then the photos from the Firebase cloud, and finally the list of clips from the cloud which once selected takes you to a video player.


## Improvements:

Due to my little experience with Unity at the time when I made this game there are quite a few things that can be improved upon.

Ideas for Improvement:
 - Make longer levels.
 - Add way to use coins collected to unlock new wheel designs.
 - Add more levels or auto generate levels.
 - Create system that allows you to promote through levels.
 - Clean up code and make game run smoother.
